# Welcome to My Free Code Camp Repository

Rather than using this repository for a project, I am going to use this as a medium to document my progress as I work through the Free Code Camp certifications. As I work through the certifications, I am going to write notes in the wiki. My solutions to any problems and projects can be found in the directories.

Please keep in mind that I am using this repository as a way to develop my programming skills and, as a result, my code will not be perfect. Furthermore, since I will be following an online course, once I have completed a project it is unlikely that I will return to it and update the code.
